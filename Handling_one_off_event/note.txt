As we mentioned earlier, events are handled through the use of listeners. A listener
is the association of an event with a callback function that gets triggered each time the
event occurs. For example, a TCP socket in Node has an event called data thatâ€™s triggered
whenever new data is available on the socket:
socket.on('data', handleData);
